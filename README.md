# MomentProblem

Imagine a situation when you want a probability distribution with a specified series of moments. Such a thing can happen e.g. when we investigate statistical properties in Monte Carlo studies. The idea behind this repository is to collect methods to achieve that, i.e. functions that:

* Approximate a distribution from specified moments
* Evaluate the appropriateness of the approximation
* Visualise the results
